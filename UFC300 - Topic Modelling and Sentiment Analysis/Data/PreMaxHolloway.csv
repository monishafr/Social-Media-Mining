craniel-mandark,"I love max, but Gathje is gonna destroy him dude.  Justin been lookin better and better in every fight he takes and he was already dope to begin with.  Justin’s got the potential to beat Islam imo",2/28/24 2:14,9
trumpjustinian,"I’m rooting for Justin and I’m worried that Max might win, but frankly I wonder if Max is still as good as he was a few years ago. He looked great against Arnold Allen and TKZ, but seemed a bit worse in his third Volk fight and Yair Rodriguez fight. 
This is basic MMA math but Max was extremely competitive against Dustin when they fought and he was undersized in that fight; now that Max is actually bulking up appropriately he should do even better and Dustin is just as good if not better than Gaethje so MMA math says Max has a really good chance. So it really just depends on whether Max has gotten better or worse since then.
Gaethje likes to slip punches instead of blocking so I can imagine Max landing a 1-2 or maybe a well timed knee when Gaethje dips down. Max’s cardio might be a problem for Gaethje as well since they both land 7 signature strikes per minute on average but Gaethje absorbes more strikes per minute than Holloway so it’s possible that Max wins a decision by output. I think Gaethje will need to distinguish himself by landing more damaging shots than Max in order to win the scorecards.
TLDR: GAY CHEESE WILL DESTROY MAX “WASHED UP” HOLLOWAY YOU FEWL",2/28/24 1:28,3

Max does not change. He's a freak of nature. He's some Hawaiian God or something. Justin has been dropped before. He will recover because he'll lean on his wrestling for a minute. Max is skinny and slithery. That may not work. He's the only man I've seen with no ground game beat wrestlers and BJJ fighters.

Few-Veterinarian-837,"Idk how I feel about this fight for Max.
Max absorbs a lot of strikes, but he typically rolls with them and doesn't absorb the full impact, so the numbers don't tell the full story. Having said that, he's also used to having a height and reach advantage, which he won't have this time.
Max also is pretty heavy on his lead leg, which Justin is undoubtedly going to chew up. You can practice checks and maybe make some adjustments, but you're never going to completely change your style after this many years for 1 fight.
I don't see either of them knocking each other out quickly, or having a grappling exchange. I have a feeling this will be a long, drawn-out, violent, blugeoning fight, and they'll both be pretty banged up regardless of who wins.

I saw one poster saying Max will probably be like Hendo and lose his chin in his 40s but that person didn’t know Hendo started MMA at 27-28 so he didn’t have the same fight mileage while Max was has been in the UFC since he was 21 and he started at 19.",3/18/24 16:59,6
trumpjustinian,"Max vs. Dustin was very competitive and now Max is properly bulking up so this will be a very close fight. Max will have high volume and pressure but Justin will land the more damaging shots so I think Justin will win by decision. 
However, I wouldn’t count out the possibility of Max landing a perfectly placed 1-2 or knee when Justin is ducking or slipping punches. I’m supporting Justin and I had a nightmare where Max rocked him with a knee before finishing him in the first round so I’m worried lol.",3/18/24 18:12,2
Cum-Gun-5000,"There is really no positive outcome for this fight. Two fan favorites are going to get banged up really bad, and there's a high probability of Max never being the same again. And both dudes are right on the cusp of an undisputed title shot and this fight will delay them both, and most likely push the loser further away from his.",3/18/24 22:54,1

JamilaoBR,"You should rewatch the fight brother, the power discrepancy was visible early but in the later rounds Poirier had to resort to wrestling and clinching to win, with that said, Justin leg kicks will be the biggest factor in this fight and I think Gaethje takes it.",3/18/24 17:03,28
Icy-Armour,"Yeah, Gaethje is going to chew that leg up. Then Max will become a sitting duck in round 3 and Gaethje gets the TKO win
Having infinite cardio won't matter when you can't even move properly after absorbing those leg kicks.",3/18/24 15:53,21
Illustrious_Season32,Max didn’t lose every exchange against Dustin and he took two rounds off Dustin while some even had him winning.,3/18/24 16:58,14
TheMrIllusion,The fight was closer than you think it was if you rewatch it. Max was starting to get Porier in trouble as the fight went long and this time he's building muscle instead of just not weightcutting as much like he did for the Porier fight.,3/18/24 18:52,3
[deleted],i would hope that max could incorporate more grappling in this fight,3/18/24 16:18,5

ImHerPacifier,We need ilia vs Justin,3/19/24 12:38,1
Cum-Gun-5000,"What a different timeline that would have created, with a much higher probability of Volk still being champ. If Max fought Ilia first, it would have bought Volk a lot more time to recover from his KO loss to Islam as well as the busy schedule he's had in the last year or so. And there was a good chance that Max could have beat Ilia too, in which case we may have got Volk vs Max IV, which again i think would have favored Volk because Max would have absolutely taken some big damage fighting Ilia, and Volk would have been a lot more rested for that fight than he was for Ilia.",3/18/24 22:50,3
ayoubkun94,"It never was, and it got even more cringe when Usman sent Masvidal to the shadow realm and he still kept it for some reason lol.",3/18/24 16:07,13
Substantial_Donkey49,Hahahahahaha this,3/18/24 16:04,2
Cum-Gun-5000,"I think it became real when Gaethje fought Poirier for it. Diaz vs Masvidal made it a consolation prize, akin to the Intercontinental title in WWE. But Gaethje and Poirier are both legit top tier fighters, so it lent the BMF belt a little more credibility when they fought for it. Same here when it's Max vs Gaethje. Both guys are clearly in the top 3 of their divisions, one a former interim champion and the other former undisputed champion. ",3/18/24 22:46,1

usa_in_dis_hoe,"He's in immediate title contention at 155 if he wins.
Also, this fight was agreed to prior to Ilia becoming champ, so it's not like Max had a clear path to a 145 title if volk was still champ",3/18/24 18:27,26
eye_am_bored,"I honestly agree, it's not the smartest fight for Gaethje, max or the UFC, but since it is happening I'm glad Max isn't rushing it the same way he did with the Dustin fight",3/18/24 19:04,8
letsgobrooksy,Whats the point of cleaning your dishes if they're just going to get dirty again?,3/18/24 20:45,2
Iluv2extract,Dustin even admitted post-fight that he wasn't sure he did enough to get the W decisively.,3/18/24 19:40,9
Cum-Gun-5000,"I can't help but feel that Gaethje is just too much. He is like an immovable object. He is incapable of backing off and the only way to get him to stop throwing full throttle punishment your way is to just shut his lights out or completely constrict his breathing on the ground where he can't hit you. Even then, when he's severely rocked and a light breeze away from being knocked unconscious he's still throwing heat instinctively. Max just won't let himself go down no matter how badly he's hurt, and I feel like he's going to take so much damage against Gaethje that he will never be the same afterwards. The only way Max comes out of this fight in one piece is if he gets a quick sub win (LOL), a quick KO win (not gonna happen either) or if Gaethje gets a bullshit standing TKO like Belal got over Brady. But I don't see those things happening. I see Gaethje doing irreversible damage to Max over the course of 25 minutes, or Max's chin finally breaking in the later rounds. I don't like this fight because of what the blowback will be, but it is exactly the kind of extremely exciting fight that we fans want. Just sucks that Max might have to die for it.",3/18/24 22:41,6
ZodtheGeneral,Is that right? OK. I'll do that. I seem to remember Max getting hurt in every exchange. Thanks for the suggestion.,3/18/24 18:02,5
ZodtheGeneral,"Honestly, this is one of the few big fights I just don't want to see. Love both these guys and would rather see both fight for titles in their respective weight classes.",3/18/24 16:54,18
Rocked_Glover,"I had been believing you guys saying “It was ACTUALLY a close fight! It wasn’t domination”, I rewatched the damn thing and Max was getting peppered. You look at the judges scorecard none of them had him winning two rounds.
I don’t know if you guys are just rewatching some short highlights, didn’t rewatch it at all just going off memory or if you’re trying to say *technically* Max didn’t look out of his depth, Max did have moments but immediately followed with Dustin landing a huge bomb that rocks him around the cage. 
He didn’t lose *every* exchange though, but it’s far and few between…",3/18/24 17:33,10
ZodtheGeneral,I'm definitely going to rewatch the fight. My memory is a shitshow.,3/18/24 18:04,2
ZodtheGeneral,"With the exception of Khabib, has anyone taken Justin down?",3/18/24 16:53,7
PuckPov,"Gaethje is a NCAA D1 all-American wrestler, who just happened to fall in love with knocking people out. Unless he’s completely forgotten everything about wrestling, I think he handles max on the ground easily.",3/18/24 16:22,15

adventuredream1,They should have shelved max until after ilia and volk fought instead of sending our boy to cte city and early retirement,3/18/24 18:37,1
adventuredream1,"I wish they would just cancel max vs gaethje. We can do max vs ilia in the fall and gaethje vs islam in June since that’s when the champs are saying when they want to fight next.
Max vs Justin makes no sense. And if max takes a ton of damage again from gaethje and then loses to ilia afterwards then we’ll all be wondering how pre gaethje max would have done against ilia.
Gaethje tore dustin’s quad with leg kicks and dealt life altering damage to Tony. I don’t want max to take damage from Justin before fighting ilia",3/18/24 20:01,9

Illustrious_Season32,I rewatched the fight like two days ago and I had it 3-2 Dustin. Max 100% took off two rounds.,3/18/24 18:13,2
No_Truck9453,"You should, Max too, rounds 3 and 4 to me and round 5 was super close. IDK why some people act like that was just a beatdown, max did super well coming up on short notice. And never got dropped or finished in the pocket aganst Poirier of all people. Max is a savage. He is moving up properly this time and has volume that Gaethje has never seen. Leg kicks will be a problem but we don't know how much pop Max will have in his punches by bulking up. This is closer then some people think. He took the fight to Poirier better then anyone ever in the pocket and the dude came off the couch. Don't forget Poirier is leaning Max aswell",3/19/24 11:39,1
