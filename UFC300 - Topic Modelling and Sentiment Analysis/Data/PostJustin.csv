Justin took a ton of damage literally until the last second of a 25 minute fight and ended up face down. He had Max in trouble once but Max regrouped and is a class act for giving Justin a chance to win by KO even though he could have played it safe and ran the last round.

There aren't many guys that would make it 4 rounds in that kind of shape and he fucking delivered. Knocked Max down twice which no one has ever done and then went all in dispite his condition. Sure it was his only real chance of winning but he chose to sacrifice his body for a epic finish and it delivered. Mad respect to him. Max took the bigger risk for the fight but Justin probably took a bigger risk for his career. He might not fight again and I'd say he gave us a hell of a show if this is his last fight. A true BMF. And no disrespect to Max, he fucking delivered but it takes two to tango and imo it was the best fight of the night because of both of them.

If Dustin loses, I could see both of them hanging it up, but I could also see either of them calling each other out.

No hate towards either fighter, that was the fight all of us wanted to see barring who won or not. We wanted a war, we got one.

They were feeling each other out at range with Max getting a little more active than Gaethje but those leg kicks were landing and you could see when it was starting to mess with Max. But that turning back kick changed everything and once Gaethje breathing was noticeably bothering him Max knew it was time to turn up the pace and just land more punches.

I truly believe that if Gaethje shoots a take down once or twice this fight is totally different. But that‚Äôs the thing with a guy like Gaethje don‚Äôt expect him(especially not at UFC 300) to try and squeeze out some boring wrestling win against a guy like Max.
