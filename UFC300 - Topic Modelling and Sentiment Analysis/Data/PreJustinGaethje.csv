Kapela1786,When was the last time max got KOd? Something to think about. Justin will try to brawl with max if he doesn‚Äôt immediately shoot. If he chooses to stand Max will pick him apart until he‚Äôs forced to take a shot from way outside ideal distance. I think Max will catch him in a darce after shooting for a leg and try for a finish but within 5 seconds Max will know it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôll finish Justin from there and use it to get on top and get back to his feet. I believe this will happen if Justin doesn‚Äôt clip max when he explodes to close distance to throw a home run over hand right followed by the wild unbalanced left hook. lol üòÇ,12/25/23 11:21,1

Djlittle13,"This could end real real bad for Max, like Gaethje could do to him what he did to Tony.
As good an offensive striker Max is, he is not exactly known for his defense. While he holds the record for most sig strikes landed (around 3100), he also has the record for most sig strikes absorbed (around 2100).
While he could land the perfect shot, he also doesn't have massive power, and Gaethje has a great chin. If Gaethje lands on him the way Porier did, it will be a bad bad night for him with possible long-lasting effects.
When Max's chin finally cracks, the downfall of his career could be catastrophic, and this very much looks like the fight that could do it.",12/25/23 12:37,1

He has grown patience into his game.  He didn't lose a step, he added one.  Exactly why he beat Dustin the second time.  His timing is different.  He isn't balls to the wall without a care if he loses anymore.  He got emotional in the Charles fight bc of Rose's fight before hand.  He knocked down Charles twice and unfortunately he got choked out.  That's not out struck, that's out grappled.  
I will however agree that Max isn't washed up in any way.  If anything, Volk is just his Achilles heel. I would argue that Max won the 2nd fight but the decision caused the results of the 3rd fight.

And before people bitch at me I'm not saying  Gaethje has no chance, he's a good striker with great cardio and has a lot of power and we've seen that Islam can get chinned, but for as much as people complain about rematches these two fights are still way more interesting than the very likely outcome of watching Gaethje getting chocked out by a third time.",12/25/23 13:49,1
[deleted],"As a fan of Islam's style but a critic of his PR (which is probably mostly AAZ) if you win a title at 155 and if there are no contenders there who pose a threat to you then why don't you vacate and go up to 170 since there's no point in you being in the division except to collect a paycheck/build your legacy against guys you'll steam-roll?
Champ-champ needs to go away honestly, none of these guys can have their cake and eat it too. Champions cannot reliably defend their belts 2x a year and drop off to fighting once a year as is. Look at the state of boxing and the enforced defense clauses. The best do not fight the best in any meaningful timeframe and even in the UFC we lost some of the best matchups to time or freak circumstances.
If Islam wants a second belt and no one in your division is a challenge then please vacate the belt and go up/down. There's already a significant log-jam at 155 and him calling for Leon and Leon calling for Sean is getting really tiresome. If nothing else there should be a 3 title defenses minimum from contenders in your division before you can challenge for the next belt up/down.",12/25/23 14:21,1

brazilianfreak,"Almost like Power isn't a linear thing and it all depends on which shots actually connect and how clean they are, a guy like Charles might doesn't have as much explosive KO power as a dude like Chandler, but when he sets his feet and punches you with precision and technique clean square in the jaw that's going to be a way ""harder"" punch than some wild hook that lands awkwardly.",12/25/23 13:56,9

S_I_G_M_A179,"True, Max doesn't absorb every single strike to his head lol he does defend; pretty sure he was defensively sound against Allen and we already know that he can slip, duck and parry punches well thanks to his showboating against Kattar. He'll definitely use his spinning back kicks to keep distance from Gaethje and he might implement checking kicks into his gameplan for this fight. He'll definitely try to avoid most hits from Gaethje unless there's an absolute chance for him to take a bomb but deliver a potential fight ending shot. One thing is certain tho that if Max does end up beating Gaethje, it'll be fucking lit and it'll prove that Max was always the true BMF",12/25/23 7:43,1

sk1nw4lk1ng,I think Volk has the excuse because it was the short notice fight and mental health stuff. But yeah anything to shut up the Oliveira fans. I'm not even a fan of the Dagestani's but people just seem to refuse the fact that they're good at what they do,12/25/23 15:47,1

semiamusinglifter,"In terms of accolades, Max is more accomplished. But this is a bad style matchup for Max. Kattar landed 180 strikes against Max in a fight where he lost every round. That should tell you how exposed he leaves himself sometimes. And those weren‚Äôt just jabs either. Justin also loves the calf kick which would be quite effective against Max. Flat out, Max has never fought anyone with  Gaethje‚Äôs level of power before. He‚Äôs also never fought anyone of Justin‚Äôs physicality.

MasonKiller,"It doesn't have to be a large gap. It just has to be more power than Max is comfortable with. Max is a volume striker with great cardio. He also gets hit a lot.

Volk has hands for sure but he isn‚Äôt going to change the fight with one punch, let alone end it. 

It just doesn‚Äôt make sense for Islam to stand with Gaethje. The risk of getting KO‚Äôd is too high when the path to victory is clearly grappling.

Silent_Shaman,"Yeah you're not wrong, if Justin lands it's much more dangerous than Volk, but what I was thinking is that if you can defend effectively against a quicker more technical striker you should do fairly well in avoiding gaethjes bombs 

Of course he only needs to land one, but to imply Islam won't stand with him at all is wrong imo. Islam always talks about winning in ways that are best for his legacy. If someone is known for striking he wants to knock them out, if they're known for grappling he wants to submit them - I'm not saying he will, but that's the kind of thing he goes for",12/27/23 3:16,1

Gojira5400,"I don't understand your point, Justin has KO power on anyone, that's undeniable. Max's chin was REALLY tested at LW against a non power puncher. Now combine that with age + time, Max was rocked by the Korean zombie, he was battered by Volk in 3, and is an old man of the sport. Justin is also coming off a KO victory of the guy who battered Max and took his ""best boxer"" reputation. Justin's has taken a lot of damage but Max doesn't pose the one hit KO potential that Justin does.

Djlittle13,"Not really. I love Max, I like him a lot more than I do Gaethje, but he gets hit way too much in every fight, and Gaethje hits too damn hard.
Look at Max vs. Dustin 2, the biggest difference in that fight was Porier's power having a very noticeable effect on the fight. Do we want to run the risk of another Gaethje vs. Ferguson type of situation?",12/24/23 12:28,1

tjohnson530,Max is my all time fav hands down but even I dont want to see him fight Justin. We may see Max‚Äôs chin finally crack and crumble if this happens and I dont think I can ever recover from that,12/24/23 15:10,1

Absolute Dana ball sookers.
The man was injured, was he supposed to fight injured so little bitch made boys like you don't cry?
It's like making a horse race with a broke leg because some dick breather in the stands bet money it would win.
Oliveria deserves that fight more than most",12/24/23 11:13,2

vivi9090,I don't know... wear a head guard when sparring one week before your fight to avoid cuts?,12/24/23 11:12,4
vivi9090,"You have a point but he missed weight in their first fight and there's no excuse for that. After such a fuck up you're instantly under pressure if you jepodise the rematch in anyway. His injury was also avoidable if he sparred with head gear with a week left for the fight. So he doesn't deserve a 3rd opportunity over Justin who is on a monster run, putting in spectacular performances.",12/24/23 14:02,-1

Gaethje and Max are excellent examples of that, I like both fighters but Gaethje is for sure fucked when he gets older from all those head shots and Max clearly already talks pretty differently from when he was younger imo. I hope I‚Äôm just not understanding how the Hawaiian accent affects how people sound differently as they age, but I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it. They got families and I‚Äôd never take that risk if I was them.",12/24/23 18:21,4
