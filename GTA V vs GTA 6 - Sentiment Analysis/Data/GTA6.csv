RamonRCMx,"I hope the map has more variety, like multiple islands, not necessarily BIGGER than V, just with more variation.

It’d be kinda hard to do that if you have to go to your car every time to switch out weapons. What I WOULD like to see is your weapons actually showing on your character like red dead tho. Like maybe having a holster for your pistol and you can visibly see that on your character.

It's so hard to imagine them doing something that's more impressive than those were when they came out. RDR 2 looked so ridiculously good also.... how much better can GTA VI really look compared to that?
And even now, GTA V's trailers were very impressive. They showcased the cityscapes, pedestrians and environments and used music in such an elegant way.
It's difficult to even imagine 'how' they can do anything at this point that could be that special.   We shall see.  One thing that would be really cool is that if you play a cop in addition to the Bonnie & Clyde characters. That would add a huge dimension to the gameplay.",2023-11-09 16:31:01,1

Then the heist happens and we lightly get to know the protags and how they work. Then the police show up and we get to see a police stand of where they dont just walk in and get shot like in V. Then of course it would end with a police chase and more action footage.

It's already been 10 goddamn years.... it's ridiculous. It's not even like they make other side projects like Midnight Club or Bully, or Manhunt or LA Noir or State of Emergency or Max Payne.  They make nothing now except crap for online multiplayer gamers 🙄. Online multiplayer has ruined gaming. Barely any single player games are released anymore and even fewer that are worth playing.  Its just the culmination of that. 
I used to turn to Rockstar, Bethesda and Konami for great single player games and now Rockstar barely makes games, Bethesda sold out to Microsoft and Metal Gear Solid is over(understandable you can't make them forever and still have quality) and even if it wasn't they fucked over Kojima.",2023-12-07 02:49:39,0

Edit: I don't mind the delay, i know the people that are working on it are only human after all and are tired coders living off their caffeine addiction and we wouldn't want to overtire them, not good for them. Or for us because we'll get an unfinished turd like the gta trilogy definitive edition, the mercenaries DLC, or cyberpunk 2077.
They can take as long as they'd like as long as they come out with an amazing, impeccable game. 
As long as i know they're working on it, I'm okay with it taking as long as it needs to, and the creators take enough time to rest and nourish to give us the best masterpiece possible.
I hope we won't be forced to use gta + too often though. And if we did, i hope that it would allow us to play gta online without ps+ or xbox live. I think if it did, it would be good value for gta players. (Warzone is free to play without these subscription services)
Maybe the company should hire cyber security professionals as well, not only because they keep getting hacked, their games keep getting hacked as well. And maybe they should include modding in their terms of service. Since the game is good enough without mods by this point and most malicious mods call it ""for education purposes"" while they know very well that their purchasers are using the mods to abuse the game.",2023-12-07 07:53:48,1

Saw the trailer and on the 1st red frame was afraid is was going to disappoint since it had so much hype. As i saw more of the places i got more and more hyped and it surpassed my expectations. Watched 2 youtubers doing 1 hour breakdowns each because i liked their personalities. Then got bored of it and wanted it to go away because i am full and a bit bored of it but made the mistake of having gta in my reddit. 
Reasons i got bored
• i ate my meal and rockstar won't put out anything for months or a year at minimum. 
• the city was fine to show me something as a base but  i get 5 times more hyped with game play systems. I will be more interested in a detailed car damage system than a characters back story. Its weird because i love story driven games. I guess its because game play is more complex while story is more of a passive event that happens to you. 
But far as it goes the last game i was truly hyped up for was cyberpunk 2077 and it made just go into low hype while i enjoy the info but play other games.",2023-12-08 04:21:16,1

They are the industry standard for their type of game and their type of HQ games, take 5-8 years to make. TLOU2 took 8 years start to finish. Cyberpunk took 7 years (really 10) to make. 

The other thing is they have changed as a studio. Back in the 2000s, they had multiple studios working on their own project, now they have all studios working on one project. I don't think this aspect is unfair to complain about, but to call them slow is stupid. The good shit takes time.

Bluechair607,"To remove any uncertainty of my point:

***RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 IS NOT A GRAND THEFT AUTO GAME***

Or to expand, Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption are two different game franchises which (while both being triple-A, open world, gun-filled, and story-driven Rockstar games) have differences in gameplay, world, and tone that will create two different fanbases that overlap, but do not form a circle.

That is the context of u/Eamo-K's comment. The GTA fanbase (which do not care about Online) has not received any new GTA content since 2013, and *Red Dead Redemption 2 does not change that*.

It might be familiar, and even sufficient enough for the ones who enjoy both game franchises for similar reasons, but it is stupid to discount the fact that GTA fans have been starved of new (singleplayer) content for 10 years because *another game franchise* from the same studio came out in between.
