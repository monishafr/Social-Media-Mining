silly_nate,"I remember seeing the first scene with the beach and thinking it was in vice city UNTIL that second to last scene with the vinewood sign. I was also 12 and didn’t understand geography much so the desert wind farm should’ve stuck out to me as not being Florida 
Other than that, there wasn’t much that stuck out to me on that first watch (besides maybe the return of planes?) because it’s so fast paced. It was the speculation for the next 8 months (before we got screenshots) that really got to me: dogs, is that homeless guy Niko?, no way that’s Tommy and CJ, HIS KIDS WOULD BE LIKE THE KIDS ON TV??, you can retract a convertible’s top??? etc",2023-10-20 05:11:02,7

justhereforsee,"Part of me feels bad but I also wish I was your age. 
Having been able to play all other GTA games on release was one amazing experience after another.   It was nice not having to wait a decade!! 
I thought for sure GTA V was going to be a disaster.  It seemed with IV they made it darker and more “real” and I thought they would continue to push in that direction.  I’m glad I was wrong. 
With VI I’m afraid they are going to make it episodic and release a little of the single player over time.     Maybe make online too big of a priority.",2023-10-20 03:13:52,2

castiel182,"\- A lot of people, myself included, didn't understand that we were getting an entirely new map in the same vein that GTA IV's Liberty City is different than GTA III's. A lot of us thought it was just going to be the San Andreas map upscaled to HD which was kind of stupid of us in hindsight.
\- For some reason people immediately thought that Michael was Tommy. Even after hearing his voice and it sounded nothing like Ray Liotta. People literally just thought because a middle aged man was driving a blue car (there was a scene in the Vice City trailer where Tommy drives a blue car) that it was Tommy. 
\- So many people thought Franklin was CJ. There's a scene where he's running away from police in a rundown area of Los Santos dressed almost exactly in CJ's outfit.
\- I flipped my shit when I saw planes were coming back. As much as I love GTA IV, I really missed flying planes.
\- There was a lot of frustration in the community in the months after GTA V's announcement because it was announced right at the tail end of the GTA III 10th anniversary and right in the middle of the Max Payne 3 promotional cycle so we quite literally didn't get any news about GTA V until almost a year after the game was announced. It got so bad that Rockstar started banning people from their site if they mentioned GTA V.

\- The Game Informer profile on GTA V essentially broke the internet. That's when we first learned about the game having 3 protagonists and we got a glimpse at a mission (the one where you propel down the FIB building) to demonstrate how the character switching will work.",2023-10-21 05:15:35,1

Chase_75,"It took what was great from GTAIV (the realism, immersion,etc) everything good from San Andreas (stats,overall craziness), and Red Dead Redemption's idea of just packing the world with so much shit that's fun to play so the character HAS to get side tracked (in a good way) it's taken everything great from this generation of Rockstar games, and made an 'end of semester exam' so to speak. Bad parts, the game has a few minor frame rate, and graphics issues, and also the story seems to be trying to push me along in an unwelcoming way when I just want to play some tennis!   ",2013-09-18 21:30:48,79
Booyeahgames,"It's early yet and I haven't gotten through the story, so I can't talk to that.  I can say that technically the game is very pretty.  It's not going to fool anyone into thinking it's next gen, but it's impressive that it's displaying so much, so well, without issues on 7 year old hardware.
Gameplay mechanics are all improved from previous versions.  Shooting and cover works well.  Driving is still dangerous, but you've got better control over the cars this time.  I haven't flown yet, so no comment there.  Weapon switching has improved with a time slow option and a radial menu similar to Mass Effect.  The character specials are fun to use.  I will point out that there are a ton of controls, and I'm finding I forget which thing to press in the heat of things.  I suspect that's a learning curve that you'll pass.
Any one thing seems to not necessarily be best ever.  Surely there are better 3rd person brawlers or shooters and driving games.  It's the fact that there are so many of them, and they're still good on their own that makes it stand out.
The one area where I think this (and previous GTAs) do better than anyone else in the industry is creating an open world with a believable and consistent fiction.  It's not just that they have so many references and characters, it's that they deliver those through multiple mediums in the game and they're cross referenced.
For example, you hear a Weasel News report of your latest murder spree on talk radio.  You can go to the Weasel News website.  You could drive to the Weasel News building.  After the report one of the candidates running for office has an interview, and there are billboards for her, along with a campaign page, and advertisements.  People and cars inhabiting a particular area tend to look like they belong there.  Car radios tend to be tuned to radio stations that seem likely for where you pick it up.  This is the secret sauce.  The things you expect to find in a fake alternate world are pretty much all there.  It's a world that's easy to get lost in.
The other notable thing is that they blend the missions into this random world.  There's definitely scripting going on, but also randomness.  This reinforces the immersion and increases the sense of player agency in the world.  You don't tend to think about what the mission designer wanted you to, and rather, you're just trying to do it.
Still haven't progressed far in the story yet, but the few missions I've played really have amped up the action from the last one.  You're still just driving, shooting, following, chasing, etc.  It certainly didn't open with a ""Drive me home cousin"" moment.
I'm enjoying the hell out of getting lost in the imaginary world where I can drive fast cars and shoot large guns.",2013-09-18 21:52:40,18
[deleted],"I think you're posing this question a little early in the products life.
That being said, I've got a few hours into it, and the game is simply just downright fun. I think the vastly improved some things that made me really NOT enjoy IV, that being driving, mission checkpoints, and mini games. I find the driving mechanics much more enjoyable in game. The checkpoints mid mission are great, if you fail because of something silly, you arent drastically punished the way IV did. I remember rage quiting that game often. Also, the dates/friendship system in IV drove me crazy, I hated it, the bowling shit was awful. 
I haven't opened up the 3rd guy, but the first two characters are quite fun and very different. So far I'm enjoying how the story weaves in and out between them, actually curious to see where this goes.",2013-09-18 21:10:59,94
[deleted],"The *only* criticism I've got so far is that there doesn't seem to be very many ways for Franklin to make money prior to the first heist. 
This isn't going to be an issue for most people, though. It was only an issue for me because I went on an early mission where Franklin's buddy Lamar has you stop by Ammu-Nation and buy a gun. When we walked into the gun store, Lamar says, ""Hey, get that shotgun with a flashlight.""
I didn't want a shotgun, though. I wanted an assault rifle, so that's what I bought. But it turns out that buying the shotgun is a mandatory mission objective. So I had to buy the shotgun too, and that left me with about $90. 
I did several of Franklin's side missions after that, thinking I might be able to earn a little money that way. But no luck. This one girl, a friend of Franklin's, expects you to help her out for free. And this other guy, a paparazzo, pays you with a stolen bike instead of with cash.
But all in all, that's a very tiny issue.",2013-09-18 21:30:22,11
[deleted],"Short answer: Yes.  Astoundingly yes.  The AI is awesome, the voice actors have been top notch, the npc quests and random moments are varied, much more than before, the cars are detailed, refined, and you can customize them all from paint to side skirts and wheel accessories.  The shooting is improved and the weapons have a greater variety.  They can be customized and have some attachments to them.  The world ""feels"" alive.  Your actions have consequences, actual stores and stock markets change depending on what you do.  The world may not be the biggest world ever, but it is insanely detailed and lively.  
All of this and I haven't touched on the story, main characters, side quests, activies, and other vehicles out there.  This game very well could be a generational game contender.",2013-09-18 21:31:22,6
ClassySphincter,"I like the game very much. It's superior to GTA IV in almost every way.
The HUD is fucking awful though. It's too damn small, and the font for the location/street names/vehicle names is not very readable. I also think the health bar is poorly positioned, and coupled with its small size makes it hard to notice at times (no wonder the radar flashes red when you get hurt).
I also find the helicopter controls haven't improved from GTA IV that much. And now you get this nauseating camera swivel when you fly.",2013-09-18 21:33:49,13
TheXbox,"I'm not crazy about GTA and I didn't buy into the mad hype-train that preceded V. That said, I've played about 20 hours and it's been solid. 
**Pros:**
- Shooting is very similar to Red Dead. It feels good, if a bit easy (you can turn off lock-on aiming if you want to)
- Driving is perfect, so much better than IV 
- Pretty much any vehicle you can reasonably imagine, this game has, from submarines to jet fighters
- Mission design is stellar, a huge step-up from the regular ""drive here, shoot that""
- I haven't encountered a single glitch or bug in all 20 hours I've played, which for a game of this scope is nothing short of amazing
- Checkpoints return from TBOGT
- None of the social nonsense from IV
- Very few load screens
- Gorgeous landscape and cityscape
- Blaine County is *huge*
- Killer soundtrack
- Voice-acting and animation are top-notch
- All three protagonists are awesome
- Lots of side activities
- Chop
**Cons:**
- Story is not as strong as IV. A lot funnier, but less cohesive, maybe even a bit thin. Maybe I'm a sucker for philosophy and cynicism, but I preferred IV a lot more.
- The satire feels like it's treading the same ground that's been tread over and over. It's still funny, but I think we've all heard how reality TV is dumb and that the American Dream is dead. Being that the writers at Rockstar are as good as they are, I think they could afford to be more daring.
- Frame rate can get really rough at points
- Seems like there are a lot less pedestrians, even in downtown LS
- Some texture pop-in, aliasing
- No Online at launch is kind of a bummer
All that said, this is probably the best GTA yet. The scope and polish is unparalleled in gaming, and the few issues it has haven't marred my enjoyment in any significant way... besides maybe the story. If you ever enjoyed a GTA game in the past and you're looking for something that will occupy a huge chunk of your life, Grand Theft Auto V fits the bill like none other.

KingOPork,"I have never beat a GTA game. Not even close,  but I'm confident I will beat this one. They fixed the driving,  the infuriating checkpoints. I've felt challenged,  but not rage quit.  It's harder to get a wanted level and easier to get out of it.  
The detail and art assets are incredible.  I have no clue how they made so much stuff look unique. 
Only downside is the text size on the cell phone and tutorials.  I have a big and old 1080i dlp TV and I can barely read it. No option to increase the text size.  I'm sure that will occur with very few people.",2013-09-18 21:06:16,26
TornInfinity,"To put it simply, if you have ever enjoyed a GTA game then it is definitely worth $60.  The story is fairly strong, the character switching mechanic is genius, making money in the game is actually worth pursuing since there is so much stuff to buy, and the multiplayer will add endless re-playability if you are into multiplayer.  
My only complaints so far are that you get locked out from using other characters during certain parts of the story.  It fits with the narrative, but is annoying if I just want to free-roam.  Disabling missions with the phone might fix this though, haven't tried it.  Another complaint is that car saving is glitched and can cause you lose a car you spent hundreds of thousands of dollars buying and customizing.  This is a major glitch that needs to be addressed, especially before GTA Online is launched.  I also don't like that there isn't anywhere to fight that the cops won't get called, for example a fight club like in TBoGT.  They improved the hand to hand quite a bit, but it doesn't play a prevalent role anywhere in the game.  If you fight someone on the street, you get a wanted star almost immediately.  
Those are all pretty minor complaints, but it demonstrates that the game is certainly not perfect as most reviewers have implied... no game ever is.  It is still extremely immersive and one of the best games of the year.",2013-09-18 22:20:55,4

Tective,"I haven't finished it yet, but I am extremely impressed thus far.  I keep comparing it to GTAIV, and I cannot think of *a single thing* that IV does better than V.  Generally varied missions, decent gunplay (clearly ripped directly from Max Payne 3, and rightfully so), driving is more arcadey, racing-game esque, and less floaty and punishing (Franklin's special ability is identical to the slow-motion system from Need For Speed: Most Wanted - it was good then and it's good now), and it fits the wide streets perfectly.  In my opinion, this game is sitting alongside Assassin's Creed II for Most Improved Sequel Ever.  I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I am at all.",2013-09-18 23:00:21,2
dirtylongen,I also think its a little too early BUT I am thoroughly enjoying it.

MammonAnnon,"It is very short. I have already finished the story and all the side missions. All that is left are races and tedious item collection. Yawn. The missions offer zero challenge. The combat is more tedious than entertaining. 
That said, I enjoyed what little there is immensely. I just wish there had been more of it.
There is no comparison to San Andreas. There was just so much more to do, so many more missions, so many more vehicles, so much more substance. ",2013-09-20 17:55:07,2
Campstar,"Are we talking, like, *actual* criticisms or are we talking about 'this game had some screen tearing and frame rate drops and I wish it didn't kill me so easily' kind of criticisms?",2013-09-18 21:09:27,6
Tote_Katze,"I absolutely love it so far.  I never finished GTA IV just because I really hated the driving and found pretty much the whole thing boring. 
Everyone is saying what was improved and the general good points which I pretty much agree with but there are some small points that I feel could have been improved pretty easily but don't really take away from the game too much.
The first one is the melee combat.  It is very basic single punch and kick pretty much. I feel like they could have put in a few simple combos or maybe the ability to take a hostage at gunpoint or something could have been added in quite easily and would have made the bits where you need to fight someone a bit more interesting. 
Losing the cops also takes a bit too long sometimes. I like the whole running and hiding thing but sometimes i'm so hidden that they're never going to find me but still end up just sitting still for ages waiting. 
I'm currently at about 40% through so this might change but I was hoping for a bit more chance to swap between characters to change how I would do the missions. The missions where you get to change who you go are pretty awesome but just don't happen as often as I was hoping.
Again, I absolutely love this game and it's probably going to wind up being my favourite of the series. These are just some very minor things I could think of but it really doesn't take very much away from the game at all.",2013-09-18 23:37:34,1
Very_legitimate,"I don't know. I picked it up today but I'm not sure how I will feel a month or more from now.
I really like GTA personally because I really enjoy the stories they tell and how well written it all is. It's really one of the only franchises I play where I really care about the storyline, and don't skip every cutscene I can. And so far writing and such seem very high quality and it meets my expectations. I haven't finished it, but I seriously doubt the writing quality will slip. It also seems like a lengthy game which is a big plus.
As for sandbox play, it has been improved upon so if you liked it in previous GTA titles I'd expect you'd like it just as much or more here. Personally I can only do sandbox style play for 30 minutes or so at a time before I get bored with it and want to do missions, but it's always been like that. There does seem to be a whole lot more you can fuck around with though.
Whether or not it lives up to they hype and is THAT good is arguable I guess... But even if it doesn't, it's still a good game and still very worth the $60 when compared to the other games at $60.",2013-09-18 23:48:46,1

The only thing I feel doesn't belong is the cinematic music in cutscenes. This GTA tries to be alot more like a movie. In some places like when Franklin and Lamar are doing a drug deal and its about to turn south, the music is perfect. It makes the situation eerie and suspensful. Other parts it feels really out of place, in particular with Michaels family. Quirky music plays during cutscenes sometimes that make the game and story feel less serious. ",2013-09-19 01:51:41,1

This is a minor annoyance until you are in a car chase mission where the only way to know where your target is at is to watch the mini-map. Either I watch where I'm going so I don't wind up crashing and lose the guy because he turned, or doing the opposite and crashing.

Ishouldnt_be_on_here,"The shooting, specifically the aiming, still needs a lot of work, but it's much better than IV. But without the autoaim it'd still be a bitch to play. Sniping moving targets is veeeery difficult. The PC version will be much better in that regard. The driving is fun and manuveurable, but they achieved that by moving away from the realism of IV. 
It's annoyingly difficult to figure out which doors open and which don't, which is probably the most immersion-breaking aspect of the game. Rockstar's solved that problem with the golden handles in LA Noire, so I don't get how they missed that. Some subtle directing lighting would have helped, but often following the lighting (as gamers have been conditioned to do) leads you to a fake door!

* The side quest/activities feel extremely fleshed out compared to past games.
* The game has an insane amount of content, that has yet to feel repetitive.
* The game is fun, and is both gorgeous and has some of the best music i have heard from a game.
* The random events in the game is just fantastic.
* The characters so far work perfectly, and i have no problem with it, i love them. They feel more developed and real from my small amount of playtime than characters from the Last of Us. 
Cons:
* Very few buildings are robbable, and finding them is a pain in the ass. 
* There are few heists and are all part of the story
* The game has some serious frame rate issues on my PS3 (Launch PS3 Fat) that occur when driving at high speeds.
* None of the rockstar club stuff really works, which prevents some things from not working (E.g. the main stock market (BAWSAQ)). When it does work, it is extremely spotty at best. 
* The whole customize your default car, and train chop require you to own a tablet and iOS (and there is no android version ~yet~).
* No multiplayer (yet~)
The game is fantastic, and is the best game i have played this year without a doubt even though i am barely a quarter through it. I have gotten more value from my money than any other game this year even if the game ends in 5 hours. It is that good.",2013-09-18 23:06:42,1
[deleted],"I'll tell you from my brother's perspective. He has never played games and he got psyched about a week before it came out.
The first thing he did was went to the airport, stole a chopper and went to the vinewood sign to look at the city and he was completely taken aback by the size and scale and detail of it. It's a work of art, it really is. 
Then after looking at the city for about 5 minutes, he king hit a chick from behind for taking a selfie and we laughed non stop for 5 minutes. If you're a gamer, you have to play it. it's that simple.",2013-09-19 00:06:41,1
[deleted],"I'm not happy with the driving physics.
It's not that they are bad, I just like the stunt driver / Hollywood movie style driving in GTA 4. I loved the finesse in swerving through traffic trying to keep the car under control and watching the cop wipeout behind you. It's different now.
The roads are fantastic but the driving doesn't make me want to take it slow and absorb the serenity and take in what is going on Around me. It's too twitchy going slow.
With that said, the driving is very classic GTA It reminds me of GTA 3, vice city and San Andreas and definitely has its benefits. It makes the game faster and more adrenaline packed in its own way and I think it has made the game more accessible to a wider community and will benefit multiplayer.
Car damage is too low in both mechanical and cosmetic damage. This was disappointing to me.
Objects such as street lights, signs etc have horrible animation when you hit them. The physics have definitely been downgraded.
Explain how hitting a tiny little sign in a speeding truck will half its speed? It seems unnatural. Also some objects that you'd expect to be able to drive through like a volleyball net are as solid as a wall.",2013-09-19 05:15:25,1
[deleted],"I bought the game at the midnight release.  
I love Grand Theft Auto games; San Andreas is my favorite.  I was not a huge fan of GTA IV, because I thought that it was a downgrade from what SA was.  But I was hoping that V would be IV + SA.  From what I played, it is definitely that.  
However, the deal breaker for me is the performance.  The game doesn't run very smooth and the graphics, quite frankly, aren't that visually pleasing.  Though this is, I would imagine, related solely to the fact that Rockstar tried to implement an inordinately graphically ambitious game on seven-year-old hardware. I am a PC gamer, so the difference between 30 fps and 60 fps is easily delineated.
The game play, however, is great.  Looking beyond the performance, the game truly is the best GTA to date. The world is huge, and it feels alive.  The driving is better than GTA IV, and is better than any other sandbox shooter that I have played (JC2, Sleeping Dogs, etc).  The shooting feels more polished than any previous GTA. 
With that said, I regret my purchase.  I haven't played the game since Tuesday morning. I can't look past the performance issues and I think I am going to sell my copy or give it to a friend.  I'll be waiting for the PC release; the platform that will really let this game shine.
Edit:  It should be noted that I played the game for about eight hours.  I didn't do any of the story; just free-roamed.  I am waiting to do the story on PC.",2013-09-19 04:28:10,0

Vagrantwalrus,"I haven't played it yet, but by watching videos and reviews the biggest problem for me is that it's just another gta game, most of what you're doing is the same as in gta 4, but it looks and plays better. There is definitely new stuff, but most of the game is largely the same thing of driving around, shooting dudes and watching cutscenes. nothing wrong with that, its great if you enjoy it, but it seems a little bit too same-y for me. Beyond that, it doesn't seem to have the same feedback loop that saints row 3 had, where you're constantly getting respect or cash or progressing in challenges just by playing the game. Also, it's the same kind of humor as gta 4, where it kinda just pokes at everything, but doesn't really say anything substantial or especially clever about any of it.

luiginut,"Driving is easier than IV, ""better"" will depend on your taste. I find the shooting to still be a struggle, for some reason they improved with RDR then again with MP3 and have regressed. They really don't seem to want shooting people to be fun in GTA, and that's too bad because you shoot a lot of people.
The map is much more fun to explore than GTAIV (it's not all just urban sprawl), and there's an assload of surprisingly fun side tasks like tennis.
The characters are all rather unlikable but for some reason I at least enjoy the scenes with Michael, even if I don't like the actual character. Franklin is both annoying (his method of getting out of the hood involves being a jerk to all his friends all the time and apparently breaking the law with Michael as if it's any different) and his quests kind of suck. Franklin got all the missions that made up a majority of San Andreas and made it a slog -- listen to terribly-written black stereotypes, drive somewhere, drug deal gone wrong, shoot people, go home. Even his side missions are like that. At least Michael mixes it up -- [Spoiler](#s ""two of his first set are a high-speed chase to reclaim his yacht and a drug trip where you shoot aliens."")
I have not gotten Trevor yet, as I have way more fun dicking around with Michael than doing the story, but that doesn't bode well because I get bored dicking around.
EDIT: One big improvement I forgot is the mission checkpoints. I ragequit a lot in the old games from stupid shit killing me and having to start all over. Good thing too, because the cover system is still hilariously outdated so I get shot a lot more than I feel I should.",2013-09-18 23:49:21,-1

Shit, I'm 10 hours in and so far I've had Michael drive in about 10x as many multi-character missions as Franklin. For all the effort Rockstar put into the special abilities they seem to be incredibly adverse to actually letting me use them in a mission.

Meaning you might have a plan to play tennis all day, but the game tries to nudge you towards a mission. Make sure not to get too into over your head in this game basically, take things slow!

TheGodBen,"I also liked the driving in GTA4, and find GTA5's driving is a little bit of give and take. Cars have better grip and tighter suspension, which feels much better, but steering is looser and braking distance is reduced.

TornInfinity,"The driving is definitely a lot tighter depending on the type of car you are driving, as you would expect in real life.  The high-end Lambo's and Ferrari's can turn on a dime and weave in and out of traffic with no problem, which is what I would expect from a car like that.  The muscle cars have more trouble turning quickly, but are very fast on straightaways.  SUVs and trucks have poor handling, but are the best for off-roading.  You get the idea.  I don't know if they have found a good balance between realism arcade, but it was much less ridiculous than the sliding around the road like your wheels are made out of butter of IV.

Like I said, this could change and turn into more multi-character missions soon but so far it seems like they're either single character or kind of like set scenes where you would have to change character anyway. Like, you start the mission where you have to snipe with one character then chase with the other, but you don't get to choose who does what role. 
That actually reminds me of another point. Each character has their own special ability thing as well as being naturally better at certain things. It gets quite annoying when you are forced to drive with one of the other characters while the expert driving guy sits as a passenger.

The ai of pedestrians and traffic alters depending on what character you use or what part of town you are in. The nicer areas are scared of the black guy, and the ghetto you never know when someone is packing heat and if you start a fight in the hood, how many others will come join the fight. 
Car chases have never felt so real, blazing through rodeo drive or Venice beach gives me an adrenaline rush
The story makes you want to play it, unlike niko.. and the mid level saves are a dream come true.
The diverse environments are great too, liberty city never gave you a sense that you were in the world.. this I'm getting stuck playing 8 hours a day, not sure my partner or daughter appreciate that though.
Cons.
I would had loved the traffic to be bumped up to mimic LA, but I understand that it would be too much from a hardware perspective.

3. Story. It's nothing new or original, but the way it's told is unprecedented. The characters are complete psychopaths too, so following their adventures are very exciting. Chemistry between them is one of the greatest you will see in a videogame.",2013-09-18 21:52:26,3
tipsqueal,"I'm not Portgas but for me:
* Character switching. Each character is pretty unique and they're all enjoyable. It's a really cool feature.
* Improved driving/flying. It's now much more enjoyable to just drive around the city.
* They GREATLY improved the wanted star / getaway mode. Now if you switch cars you are more likely to get away. You can also be right behind a cop who is looking for you, but since you're out of their view, they will not start going after you. **You can actually fucking hide**. In every prior GTA game the cops new exactly where you were at all times. They don't anymore and it's so much better.
Edit: Those are only my top 3. There's a million other reasons to like the game.
* Character customization.
* The wide variety of activities you can partake in (races, triathlons, bike riding, etc.)
* The game world feels more alive. You can see people getting into police chases pretty often. They also end in shoot-outs pretty often.
* The world is huge, and beautiful.
* Every single feature in all the prior games are here and polished like no other. Every feature and system that you liked, but felt like could be improved has been. The game is extremely refined.

CrapInc,"I think he meant ""best open world game *until GTA VI arrives*"" :)
Played a few hours last night and here's my elaboration on his statement:

The scale of the game is noticeably bigger than GTA IV. The detail to everything is much better (vehicles, houses, weather, etc.) and is immediately noticeable when comparing IV to V. The frame drops are noticeable when there's a lot going on, but not so much to make it unplayable. The texture slow draw / pop-in rears its head every once in a while, but with the amount of stuff around you, I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.



The targeting recticule is tiny which can be difficult to see at times when you're in a shoot out and don't want to rely on the auto-lock on feature. The text on the cellphone is also pretty small (like in the previous GTA IV) which can be a little painful on the eyes depending on your tv size.

Although you only 'enjoyed it and didn't love it' You're frustrated that you haven't got more DLC, you mention so many plus points, hardly any negatives, with not much explanation to them, apart from the characters, cynicism, btw, it never was a PS5 release. I don't know what's not to love from your review and words, which made it sound like......... well....... You loved it 
Very confusing",2022-04-05 16:54:22,23
KiwiGamer450,"GTA V is definitely less well written that IV (the only other one I've played enough to know) but it's addition of having 3 main protagonists, as well as their unique abilities, and the various engine improvements makes V so much better to play. I have over 100 hours in V and I've only ever beat It once, and have rarely played online. Most of that was just driving around and messing around, which is infinitely more fun than doing the same in older games, and is where (for me, at least) the game really shines. Also, for funny brand names my favourite is definitely Gruppe Sechs.",2022-04-05 19:00:27,6

WhisperingSideways,"I quite literally finished The Big Score this morning on the PS5. I’ve played it through twice on PS3 and twice on PS4 already. 
It’s a game that still holds up, and if anything the meta-commentary on pretty much every aspect of American life has gotten even more relevant. Just listening to the endless talk radio nonsense and Weasel News clips makes it feel like a brand-new game.
The weakest links are the barely-there story, the game’s treatment of women as shrews, sex objects and things to murder and most of Trevor’s existence, but the experience itself as a whole is still very fun and fresh and I find myself more than happy to just drive or fly around and have fun in the open world.
I wish they would have actually followed through with the “expanded” side of things and broadened out the clothing and vehicle selection, or ported over some self-contained single-player games from GTAO, but for ten bucks I feel like I got my money’s worth.",2022-04-05 17:10:21,5

It's definitely that first part- The main characters are just soooo, unlikeable? Uninteresting? Cynical?
I feel like there are five versions of each of those guys and their basic story that I could've liked, and wanted to like, but this one I guess I just dont like. Maybe it's just growing out that 13 year old boy brain that loved everything about GTA: Vice City and San Andreas",2022-04-05 17:24:33,2
ElJonJon86,"My gripe with it is the heavy focus on Franklin. Yes, Michael and Trevor are playable, but Franklin feels like the main character (Also has the most content, and Michael/Trevor stuff is optional for 100%).
I found Franklin to be the most boring GTA protagonist since that top-down dude we controlled in GTA 2. Yes, even the Gameboy GTA gmes had better written protagonists.
The star of the show is Lamar, but sadly we don't get to play as Lamar (Unless you count the recently added online content, but Franklin is also there to make it ""meh"")
Trevor is fun because of how cartoonish he is, truly a criticism on the game series.
Michael, on the other hand, is a criticism on the aging creative personalities behind GTA.
The game's story is fun, but the real charm is the world.",2022-04-05 17:07:44,4

In some particular stage of your life you become disillusioned about principles of social life, politics, business. You spot the amount of BS in public and how far as a society we moved from optimal habitats to the imaginative constructs that literally kill people but look cool and sound cool.

Anti-Scuba_Hedgehog,">  Most of that was just driving around and messing around, which is infinitely more fun than doing the same in older games
I find it completely opposite. There's zero immersion, you can't even do basic things like buy a hot dog, go into a burger shot and shoot it up, physics have been dumbed down badly, AI is dull, police chases are terrible because they have Delta Force level of aim and cars with superpowers, the original soundtrack is the weakest in the series.",2022-04-06 09:55:02,5

Anti-Scuba_Hedgehog,">  Maybe it's just growing out that 13 year old boy brain that loved everything about GTA: Vice City and San Andreas
I don't think that's the case. I played all of those for the first time as a  kid/teenager. GTA V was the only one I played at release at 18 and it was a big disappointment. I've played all of the games in the series again since and the old ones are still way better, I just got 100% in GTA San Andreas last fall. Like yeah controls and graphics and such are much worse in that one but the humor, the music, the atmosphere the charm that's all over the place beats graphics every day of the week.",2022-04-06 09:58:57,5
bestanonever,"While the PS2 games have aged a lot technically, in terms of graphics and gameplay mechanics, the story and characters might be as good or even better than what you remember. I played both SA and V recently and couldn't stand GTA V's characters either. I made a [very long post](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/tsjyc5/replays_that_changed_the_way_you_thought_about_a/) about my current feelings regarding V. Long story short: the characters are too obnoxious to save the lame-ass story.
But guess what? San Andreas is still a lot of fun. It has the best rag-to-riches story of the franchise and watching the cutscenes and listening  to the radio is as good as day one. Wish they had the longer cutscenes GTAs have used ever since IV. Can't get enough of wackos like The Truth, Sweet and even assholes like Tennpeny and Toreno. The fun factor is still there. And I'm sure Vice City  must be good, as well.",2022-04-06 16:39:45,1

Even the negative point about no DLC, and how the OP yearns for more, indicates how much they enjoyed it, if they're that disappointed with not getting more, it indicates that OP clearly felt a lot more than just standard enjoyment, along with the majority of the rest of the post.

If 'one' doesn't like a game, or finds it hard to love, maybe give some real explanation, rather then a seemingly glowing report on mostly the benefits and what the game does really well. Even a more balanced report on the pros and cons world have made more sense, but it's pretty much all positive about how OP found a lot of it to be amazing, fun, and had a fantastic time with the game by all accounts, and even if they didn't love certain aspects, it definitely sounds like they loved a lot of others.",2022-04-05 21:55:30,8

Great_Ad4139,The fact you chose that option shows that your a delusional bitch who didn’t understand the dynamic between Michael and Franklin nor did you understand those characters individually. It was your choice to delude yourself into thinking Franklin was a sociopath and hence make him kill his own mentor which he hadn’t shown any resentment towards the whole story.,2023-04-15 23:45:19,0
ElJonJon86,"I chose every option, you utter imbecile child. Do you not yet understand games can be replayed? I honestly don't get why you're even here replying after I made it quite obvious any further input from your soft undeveloped brain would be irrelevant.

Anyone who doesn't easily recognize Franklin's sociopathic behaviour is probably unable to differentiate between an eggplant and a carrot.

A sociopath shows no regard for right or wrong (Examples: Breaking into a house to repo a vehicle. Murdering random businessmen to get rich off the stocks), ignores the rights and feelings of other people (Best example is his treatment of Lamar, but also all his interactions with freaks and strangers).
